# Data transformation
In our data transformation script, we perform the following steps:
1. Since all data are `.csv` files, we load them using the `read.csv()` function in R. 
2. We drop the unnecessary variables in the bike-sharing data: `Duration`, `Start Station`, `Rnd Station`, and `Bike number`. 
3. We choose the variable `Start Date` to represent the occurrence time of the bike riding. It is separated into four date and time variables: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, and `Hour`. 
4. For the temperature data, we change the format of the variable `DATE` to the standard practice `YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. We merge the two data sets on the index date variable by using `left_join()` function in the `dplyr` package. 
6. We add the variable `workdays`, which is true if the day is not a holiday or weekend and false otherwise.
7. Since the size of the data frame is too large with every row representing a single trip, we change the granularity to hour by aggregation over the total count of bike riding trips in each hour of a day. The derived data set is condensed to 16,889 rows with 13 variables:

* Year - Year of the occurrence of the bike riding, 2019
* Month - Month of the occurrence of the bike riding
* Day - Day of the occurrence of the bike riding
* Hour - Hour of the occurrence of the bike riding
* PRCP - The amount of pricipitation
* SNOW - The amount of snow
* SNWD - The depth of snow
* TAVG - The average temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMAX - The maximum temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMIN - The minimum temperature in Fahrenheit
* workdays - Indicating if it is a workday
* Member.Type â€“ Indicates whether user was a "registered" member or a "casual" rider
* num - Number of bike riding
