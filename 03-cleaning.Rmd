# Data transformation
All the data we found is in csv files. They can be imported by R using read.csv() function. 

The bike sharing data contains unnecessary variables for the analysis: *duration*, *start station*, *end station*, and *bike number*. Those columns are dropped. In addition, we choose variable *start date* indicating the time of occurrence of the bike riding. The variable is separated into four variables: *Year*, *Month*, *Day*, and *Hour*. 

For the temperature data, the format of dates is not in a preferable format like "YYYY-MM-DD". After change the format of variable *DATE*, by using *left_join()* function in the dplyr package we can merge data sets of bike sharing and weather on index variable *DATE*. 

To find out how workdays affect bike sharing, the variable *workdays* is added. It returns true if the day is not a holiday nor weekends and false otherwise.

The data set tends to be large when every row represents a trip of bike riding. Instead, we decide to compute the number of bike riding every hour. The length of derived data set is 16889 and there are 13 variables.

* Year - Year of the occurrence of the bike riding, 2019
* Month - Month of the occurrence of the bike riding
* Day - Day of the occurrence of the bike riding
* Hour - Hour of the occurrence of the bike riding
* PRCP - The amount of pricipitation
* SNOW - The amount of snow
* SNWD - The depth of snow
* TAVG - The average temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMAX - The maximum temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMIN - The minimum temperature in Fahrenheit
* workdays - Indicating if it is a workday
* Member.Type â€“ Indicates whether user was a "registered" member or a "casual" rider
* num - Number of bike riding
