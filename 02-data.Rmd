# Data Sources

## Bike sharing data

As we found our common interests in transportation systems, we noticed that unlike public transportation systems such as bus and subway, bike sharing systems have explicitly recorded statististics like the duration of travel, departure and arrival position. Therefore, we searched online for data related to bike rental. At first, we searched for related data sets on Kaggle, a website contains many data sets for data scientists to work on. We found a data set about Capital Bikeshare. To ensure reliability of the data, we decided to use data directly from the Capital Bikeshare database. Moreover, downloading data directly from the database allowed us to analysis the latest riding data of 2019. We did not choose data from 2020 because with impact of COVID 19, we supposed the lifestyle has been largely influenced. The data set we decided to work on can be found on http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.

There are 7 variables in the data set:

* Duration – Duration of trip
* Start Date – Includes start date and time
* End Date – Includes end date and time
* Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
* End Station – Includes ending station name and number
* Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
* Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member or a "casual" rider

Number of observations: 3398417



## Weather data

Then, weather conditions are collected from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ to fill the corresponding weather information for each record. Unfortunately, we cannot directly download the data files from the website. The weather data we requested from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ is located at folder "temp_data".

There are 7 variables in the file:

* DATE - The index variable indicating the date when data was collected.
* PRCP - The amount of pricipitation
* SNOW - The amount of snow
* SNWD - The depth of snow
* TAVG - The average temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMAX - The maximum temperature in Fahrenheit
* TMIN - The minimum temperature in Fahrenheit

Number of observations: 365

## Holiday schedules

Holiday schedules can be found on http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule. There is no data file that can be downloaded from the website. Since there are only couples of holidays in 2019, we decide to simply type them down during the data preprocessing.

## Issues

First of all, We discovered that there are a couple of unnecessary variables in the bike sharing data such as *bike number*. Furthermore, the variables *Start Date* and *End Date* contain both date and time. We need them to be separated for analysis purpose. The third problem is that the size of data set is so large that the R computation could be slow during analysis.
