# Data Sources
As we find our common interests in transportation systems, we notice that unlike public transportation systems such as bus and subway, bike sharing systems have explicitly recorded statististics like the duration of travel, departure and arrival position. Therefore, we searched online for data related to bike rental. The dataset we decide to work on can be found on http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. Then, weather conditions and holiday schedules are collected from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ and http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule to fill the corresponding weather and seasonal information for each record.
